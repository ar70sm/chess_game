# Chess Game Project

## Overview

I have developed a responsive and optimized chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary focus was on quick responsiveness, minimal data consumption, clean code, and adherence to all chess rules. The game is designed to run seamlessly on both computer and phone platforms.

## Game Features

### 1. Intelligent Piece Movement

- When clicking on a piece during its team's turn, the valid moves and potential captures are highlighted. Additionally, the king is alerted in the event of a threat.

### 2. Test Mode

- A "Test Mode" button allows users to move pieces freely, enabling the design of specific puzzles. This feature enhances creativity and strategic thinking.

### 3. Sound Effects

- A "Sound" button plays a sound effect when pieces are moved, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

### 4. Rotate Board

- The "Round" button enables users to rotate the chessboard based on the team whose turn it is. This feature provides flexibility and accommodates user preferences.

### 5. Reset Game

- A "Reset" button returns the game to its initial state, allowing users to start a new game or undo any changes made during gameplay.

### 6. All Out

- An "All Out" button removes all pieces from the playing table, facilitating the insertion of pieces one by one in Test Mode. This streamlines the puzzle design process.

### 7. Movement History

- Below the playing table, a record of movements is displayed, allowing users to advance and reverse moves as desired. This feature enhances the overall gaming experience and strategic analysis.

## Code Optimization

- The code is designed for quick responsiveness, minimal data consumption, and cleanliness. Code reuse is prioritized to eliminate redundancy and maintain a compact codebase.

## Platform Support

- The game is optimized for both computer and phone platforms, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience across various devices.

## Conclusion

This chess game project combines intelligent gameplay features, responsiveness, and user-friendly options for an engaging and enjoyable chess-playing experience.
